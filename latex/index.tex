The game starts out by displaying a menu system. This was created using the Qt Designer drag-\/and-\/drop G\+UI widgets.\hypertarget{index_controlsmenu}{}\section{Controls Menu}\label{index_controlsmenu}
In the main menu, the user can select the \char`\"{}\+Controls\char`\"{} option, which will open a new screen showing the basic movement and fire buttons.\hypertarget{index_level1menu}{}\section{Level 1}\label{index_level1menu}
When the user presses \char`\"{}\+Play\char`\"{}, Level 1 starts with 1 enemy. The user has 3 lives and if all of them are lost, they are returned to the main menu. If they defeat the enemy, they move on to Level 2.\hypertarget{index_level2menu}{}\section{Level 2}\label{index_level2menu}
This level contains 4 enemies. Only one enemy fires at a time, but the enemy which fires is chosen at random. Once all 4 enemies are defeated, the user moves on to the final boss in Level 3.\hypertarget{index_level3menu}{}\section{Level 3}\label{index_level3menu}
This level contains one boss that fires 4 large projectiles at the player. The boss also has 10 HP, meaning that it takes 10 shots to kill. Once the boss is defeated the player has cleared the game and is shown the victory screen.\hypertarget{index_victorymenu}{}\section{Victory Screen}\label{index_victorymenu}
